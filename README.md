# Business Analytics

This repository contains python code and report for business analytics project on loan service dataset, generated by University of Nottingham's N-Lab research group. This was part of the BUSI4371 module taught at the UoN.

Quick Overview:

In this project, using pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn , the following tasks were accomplished:

- Visualise, standardize and analyze the data in depth through statistical metrics

- Perform data balancing during training phase using ADASYN/SMOTE algorithms

- Perform feature selection using decision tree

- Handle heterogeneous data (mixture of categorical and continuous data)

- Employ logistic regression, naive bayes classifier and k-nearest neighbours

- Perform hyper-parameter tuning using grid search and use cross validation for final model evaluation

- Offer insights in the report on the target demographic for offering new loan services. 

The report, along with the code (ipython notebooks) and dataset have been included to recreate the exact findings
